### Task, Process & Compliance Management Platform

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern organizations execute their operations through structured tasks, processes, and compliance-driven activities. However, in many environments, these activities are managed using fragmented tools such as emails, spreadsheets, or messaging platforms, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and accountability gaps.

Common challenges include:

- Lack of centralized task and process tracking
- Unclear ownership and responsibility for tasks
- Delays caused by undefined approval and escalation chains
- Poor visibility into task progress and compliance status
- Incomplete or missing audit trails
- Difficulty generating accurate operational and compliance reports

This project aims to develop a **centralized, web-based Office & Organisational Workflow Management System** that standardizes task execution, enforces predefined workflows, integrates compliance checks, and maintains complete audit logs. The system improves transparency, accountability, and operational control across departments.
